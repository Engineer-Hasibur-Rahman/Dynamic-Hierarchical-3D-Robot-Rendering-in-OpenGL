## 🤖 Dynamic-Hierarchical-3D-Robot-Rendering
This project demonstrates **hierarchical robot modeling** using **OpenGL** with transformations like:
- **Translation (`glTranslate`)**
- **Rotation (`glRotate`)**
- **Matrix Stacking (`glPushMatrix`, `glPopMatrix`)**

Each robot part is modeled **independently** but connected using **parent-child relationships**, allowing **joint-based movements**.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Multi-Part Model**: The robot consists of **4 hierarchical levels**, making movements more natural.
- **Controllable Joints**: Move key parts of the robot (**head, arms, legs**) using keyboard inputs.
- **Animations**:
  - **Walking Animation** (`W` to start, `w` to stop): Simulates stepping by rotating hip and leg joints.
  - **Spinning Cannon** (`S` to start, `s` to stop): Rotates the cannon continuously.
- **Dynamic Camera Control**: Change viewpoints to explore the robot in 3D.
- **Realistic Material & Lighting**: The model features **real-time shading**, including:
  - **Metallic blue**
  - **Matte white**
  - **Glossy red**
  - **Khaki yellow**

## 🛠 Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- **Visual Studio 2022** (or compatible version)
- **OpenGL & GLUT Libraries** installed
- **Windows OS** (Tested on Windows 10 & 11)


---

## 🕹 Usage
- **Move Camera**: Use arrow keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`).
- **Rotate the Robot**: Press `R` key.
- **Walking Animation**: Press `W` to start, `w` to stop.
- **Spin Cannon**: Press `S` to start, `s` to stop.
- **Change Perspective**: `A`, `D`, `W`, `S` keys.
